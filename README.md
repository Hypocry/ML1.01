# DEX MACHINE LEARNING 1.01 projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks forming an AI-driven project. It seems to focus on image recognition (such as cat vs dog classification), fuel consumption analysis, and possibly an automated feeding system. Each notebook has a specific role in this ecosystem.

## 📁 Notebooks

- `cat_dog.ipynb`: Likely contains an image classification model for distinguishing between cats and dogs.
- `compare_gas-fuel.ipynb`: Compares gas usage and fuel options, possibly using data analysis or machine learning techniques.
- `feeder.ipynb`: Appears to be related to an automated feeding system (potentially connected with image recognition).
- `trainer.ipynb`: Handles the model training process.
- `worker.ipynb`: Likely the inference or deployment component of the system.

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ Note: Some libraries like `dlib` and `pyttsx3` may require additional system-level dependencies. Refer to their official documentation for guidance.

## 🚀 Usage

Open the notebooks using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

Follow the notebooks step-by-step. For example, start with `trainer.ipynb` to train a model and use `worker.ipynb` to run inference with it.

## 📦 Requirements

See the `requirements.txt` file for a full list of Python dependencies.

## 🤖 Features

- Image classification using deep learning
- Data analysis for fuel/gas comparison
- Potential IoT integration (e.g., feeders)
- Voice output using `pyttsx3`
